Made this classic tic tac toe game using html css and javascript. Visit the game using http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html 

Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game. This game has a 3x3 grid, and in their turn, each player places their marker (X or O) on a cell in this grid.
In order to win, a player has to complete a full horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker. If all cells are filled and no player managed to do this, it is a draw.

Some of the main features included in my game are 
 
  1.Randomly starting with Player X or Player O.
 
  2.Counting the number of wins of both the players.
  
  3.Reset the score of plaeyrs to 0.
